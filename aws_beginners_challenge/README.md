## My AWS Challenge

I‚Äôm taking on the AWS Beginner‚Äôs Challenge!
Over 4 projects, I‚Äôll be building hands-on experience with core AWS services and foundational cloud concepts.

I‚Äôm learning AWS because I want to return to my roots as a Site Reliability Engineer and grow into a DevOps/Cloud Engineer. My goal is to rebuild my technical foundation, sharpen my automation skills, and prepare myself to confidently land a role in cloud engineering again.

### Hold Me Accountable!

I‚Äôm challenging myself to complete all 4 projects in the next 4 days.

To make it happen, I‚Äôll keep myself accountable by setting daily goals, tracking my progress publicly, and sharing updates about what I learn after each project.

My reward for completing this challenge will be taking a day off to relax and reflect, and then moving on confidently to the next step of my AWS and Cloud Engineering journey. ‚òÅÔ∏èüíª

## What is Cloud?

Before cloud computing, we had to rely on large physical storage devices, such as hard drives, USB drives, or memory cards, to save and transfer files, photos, and videos. Sharing or moving data between computers often requires plugging in external drives or manually copying files from one device to another.

Now, with cloud computing, everything is much simpler and faster. Files can be stored, accessed, and downloaded from anywhere through the internet. We can even back up our entire device to the cloud, just like how Apple‚Äôs iCloud lets users switch to a new phone and instantly recover all their photos, apps, and settings just by signing in with their iCloud account.

### What is AWS?

AWS is a cloud platform that helps companies save money by offering online computing and storage services instead of requiring them to build expensive physical servers and data centers.

AWS professionals play a key role in building and maintaining cloud infrastructure that supports modern businesses. Some of the most common career paths in this field include Cloud Architect, DevOps Engineer, Security Engineer, and Data Engineer.

For now, I‚Äôm most interested in becoming a Cloud Engineer because they have a broad range of responsibilities, a ‚Äújack of all trades‚Äù in the cloud world. This role allows me to explore different areas of cloud computing first, and later decide which specialization to focus on as I gain more experience.
