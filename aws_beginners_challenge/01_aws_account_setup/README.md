## Getting Started With AWS

Setting up my AWS account took around 10 to 15 minutes. The process was simple; I just needed to enter my personal details, verify my email, and confirm my identity.

AWS asks for your credit card details only for verification purposes. It helps confirm that you’re a real user and prevents misuse of the Free Tier. You won’t be charged unless you go beyond the free limits or upgrade to a paid plan

The first projects I’m working on are the AWS Beginner’s Challenge projects, which include learning how to launch an EC2 instance, set up an S3 bucket, and manage IAM users.

I’ll start the first project today to build momentum and refresh my cloud fundamentals.

I’ll make time for doing projects by setting aside at least one to two hours each day, usually in the evening, so I can stay consistent and finish all four projects within the next few days

## AWS Free Tier

When you sign up to AWS, you automatically get access to free usage of select services and experiment with computer power, storage, databases, and more

The AWS Free Tier includes three different types of free offers:
-  $100 USD in credits when you create your account
- An additional $100 USD in credits that you can earn by completing learning activities
- Access to all "always free" AWS services to explore and build projects.

After my 12-month Free Tier period ends, I’ll still have access to my AWS account and all its services, but I’ll start getting charged based on my actual usage under the pay-as-you-go pricing model.

I’ll stop getting free access to the 12-month Free Tier offers like EC2, RDS, and S3 limits that were part of the initial promotion.

To make sure I remember this date, I’ll set a reminder in my calendar a few weeks before my Free Tier expires so I can review my usage, delete unnecessary resources, or upgrade to a paid plan if I want to keep using AWS.
