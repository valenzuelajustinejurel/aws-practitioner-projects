## 🧠 About This Repository

This repository serves as my **cloud learning portfolio**, where I document each hands-on project I complete while studying AWS fundamentals.  
Every folder contains:

- 📘 A **README.md** explaining the objective, setup steps, and outcomes
- 🧩 Supporting screenshots or architecture diagrams
- 🧠 A short **reflection** on what I learned from the lab
