## The Project

In this chatbot series, I’m learning about how chatbots work using Amazon Lex, including intents, slots, and Lambda integrations. By the end of the 5 projects, I will have a fully functional chatbot that can handle real conversations and user data. I’m building a chatbot to understand natural language, automate simple tasks, and create a more interactive user experience.

## Hold me accountable!

I will set aside time each day to complete one project per day in this chatbot series. I will keep myself accountable by tracking my daily progress and staying consistent. My reward for completing this chatbot series will be the satisfaction of building my own functional chatbot and improving my AWS skills.

### What is AI in chatbots?

AI-powered chatbots use artificial intelligence to understand and respond to users naturally. The key technologies that make this possible are natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML).

### How does Amazon Lex simplify chatbot development?

Building chatbots traditionally requires complex coding, natural language processing, and backend setup. Amazon Lex simplifies this by providing built-in AI for understanding language, easy-to-use tools for creating intents and slots, and automatic integration with AWS services — allowing anyone to build chatbots quickly without deep technical skills.
